Jacob L. Moreno's Sociogram, and how it might affect Youtube, Insta, Facebook culture


See the Author's idea on social networks. They are called sociograms.

Also, from cognitive, or social psychology, the concept of scripts, from Schank and Abelson might be interesting. They might be interesting from the point of view of artificial Intelligence.

Tran's idea of a 1-7 layered random artificial neural network is a basis of machine intelligence, and understanding, and learning.

But learning can be seriously complicated, you cannot communicate works of Plato by sign language, or by clicking with the mouse.

Programming is needed, just think about speech prediction, a classic field of AI.

If you would like to learn programming, but do not have a pc, check this out:

you can install Android on a PC (unlike OS X, that I suppose you can legally do so)....... I think the best option is to buy a celeron processor laptop...

The cheapest I could find on the net (free shipping) in 5 minutes is a refurbished notebook, with 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD!, and of course, a Celeron processor, for 109 US dollars.

??

Android needs 2GB of RAM, and 2GB! of storage space, and you can play your games, turning it into a console, install Matlab 5, or whatever. Are you crazy? You have Unix like shells, everything for Android. But, you should ask the Maestro, Linus Thorvalds, but I think he's probably not interested in modern android games :(

A quickstart: a kernel (of linux or android) is jast a layer which provides an interface (or connection) between the programs running over the kernel in memory, and the CPU. Then the CPU does the rest of the work for memory control etc. At least I think so. But I also suppose, that nobody really knows what a kernel is, except Linus, because he was the one who wrote the first linux kernel, when he was around 15. UNIX was not open source, as I remember, so I don't know.

A DAEMON is a service in windows, it is called a DAEMON in unix like systems. It is just a layer, or interface between peripherials (screen, keyboard, printers, etc) and the kernel. 

So... if you're unhappy with something, why don't you develop a DAEMON for a console controller??

But, please be responsible, if you don't know what something is, then just leave it alone....

this is interesting too:

I know, I should've partied all night, instead I was watching "Amiga story" :(((

By the way, OS X's graphical interface was actually invented by someone at Xerox...... and, if you really want to be in OS X, I'd recomment 9.1, with a G3 iMAC.

That was a PC that is still a PC now..........
